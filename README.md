# CSSE Project - London Oyster Booking System Alternative

## Introduction

This is a project developed by a group of students from the Faculty of Computing at SLIIT for the CSSE module in the third year second semester. The project is an alternative presentation of the London Oyster booking system, a smart card used for paying public transport services in London. This project showcases the skills and knowledge of the group members in developing mobile and web applications using the MERN stack.

## Technologies

Our project leverages the power of the MERN stack, a robust combination of technologies:

- **MongoDB**: A versatile, cross-platform, document-oriented database that stores data in a JSON-like format.
- **Express**: A high-performance web framework for Node.js, ideal for creating web applications and APIs.
- **React**: A dynamic library for crafting rich user interfaces using modular components.
- **React Native**: A versatile framework for building native mobile applications with the efficiency of React.
- **Node.js**: A runtime environment that executes JavaScript code beyond the web browser.

## Meet the Team

This project was a collaborative effort by a team of talented individuals, each contributing their unique skills and expertise:

- **Reezan S.A**
