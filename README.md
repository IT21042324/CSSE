# CSSE Project - London Oyster Booking System Alternative

## Introduction

CSSE is a project developed by a group of students from the Faculty of Computing at SLIIT for the CSSE module in the third year second semester. The project is an alternative presentation of the London Oyster booking system, a smart card used for paying public transport services in London. This project showcases the skills and knowledge of the group members in developing mobile and web applications using the MERN stack.

## Technologies

The project is built using the MERN stack, which includes:

- MongoDB: A cross-platform document-oriented database that stores data in JSON-like format.
- Express: A web framework for Node.js that provides features for building web applications and APIs.
- React/React Native: A library for building user interfaces using components.
- Node.js: A runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser.

- Reezan S.A
